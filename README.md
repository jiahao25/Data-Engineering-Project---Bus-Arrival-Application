# Data-Engineering-Project---Bus-Arrival-Application


# Introduction
In this Data Engineering project, I will showcase on how I design and create a bus arrival application (similar to SG BusLeh). There are 2 goals in this project:
1. To understand and appreciate how stream processing technologies such as Kafka is used in modern applications today
2. To have fun building projects like this

# Tools Used
- Language: Python
- Data Ingestion: Apache Kafka
- Storage: MongoDB
- Orchestration: Apache Airflow
- UI/Visualization: Flask

# Data Used
The data is ingested from the [LTA API](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en/dynamic-data.html) (see the Bus Arrival section), which updates the bus arrival information in real time! Which means we can technically use the information displayed on the application to see when the bus are coming.
